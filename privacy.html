            <p><strong>Last Updated: December 17, 2025</strong></p>

            <p>At The Village Vault , accessible from clashofclansvault.win, one of our main
                priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information

            <h2>No User Accounts</h2>

            <h2>No Personal Data Stored</h2>
            <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal identification information (PII) to our servers. All

                (client-side processing).</p>

            <h2>Local Data Processing</h2>
            <p>When you use our Tracker feature by pasting JSON data:</p>

                <li>Your game data is <strong>never</strong> uploaded to our servers or any third-party servers.</li>
                <li>Once you close the browser tab or refresh the page, the data is cleared from your browser's memory
                    (unless you explicitly choose to save it to your browser's local storage, in which case it remains
                    on your device).</li>
            </ul>
